This is an agreement between the owner of the @$DEVELOPER GitHub account ("Developer") and the owner of the $PRODUCT product ("Client").
The Developer agrees to keep all project-related code and information private and not share or use it outside the project.
All work done is "work for hire"—everything the Developer creates for the project belongs fully to the Client.
The Developer won't reuse any part of the work elsewhere without the Client’s written permission.
