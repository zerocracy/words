# How It Works

No matter what development process your team uses—Kanban, Scrum,
  or Waterfall—manageability [depends][measure-or-not] on how [fairly]
  and objectively you reward your most productive programmers.
Zerocracy does exactly that: it [measures][zerocrat] each person's contribution
  according to predefined and configurable bylaws, eliminating favoritism,
  subjectivity, and [emotions].

Zerocracy is non-intrusive: it doesn't tell programmers
  what to do, when, or how.
Instead, it observes their actions and informs them when
  they earn or lose points.
Programmers can view their individual contribution statistics
  in an HTML summary updated every few hours ([example][vitals]).
They also receive notifications directly in their GitHub
  issues ([example][reward]).

As a manager, you can use the points earned by programmers
  to calculate their bonuses or even salaries.
Even if you don't, the gamification alone will significantly
  [improve][effect] team productivity and reduce turnover.

Here's how it works:

1. You create an [account][baza] and get a token.
1. You create a new GitHub Actions [workflow][judges-action].
1. The workflow publishes points earned by each programmer.
1. [Zerocrat][0crat] on GitHub informs programmers when they [score].

By default, programmers only earn points through gamification.
But if you want them to get real cash as well,
  you can add funds to your account.
Zerocracy will then automatically convert their points into
  payments—transferred directly from your account to theirs, with no commission.
