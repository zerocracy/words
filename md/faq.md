## Core Understanding

**Why Does Zerocracy Use Microtasking Instead of Hourly Billing?**
We use [microtasking] because [monetary rewards] tied directly to tangible,
  [measurable] contributions motivate developers
  far more effectively than [paying for time][slavery].
By distributing the project budget based
  on [completed results][DoD]—not hours—we ensure
  that the best performers earn [more][10x] than
  they typically could in traditional, [time-based] projects.
At the same time, this approach eliminates the inefficiencies of hourly
  billing and ultimately [reduces][billing] the overall project [cost].
