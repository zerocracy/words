## Core Understanding

**Why Does Zerocracy Use Microtasking Instead of Hourly Billing?**
<br/>
We use [microtasking] because [monetary rewards] tied directly to tangible,
  [measurable] contributions motivate developers
  far more effectively than [paying for time][slavery].
By distributing the project budget based
  on [completed results][DoD]—not hours—we ensure
  that the best performers earn [more][10x] than
  they typically could in traditional, [time-based] projects.
At the same time, this approach eliminates the inefficiencies of hourly
  billing and ultimately [reduces][billing] the overall project [cost].

## Security, Access & Integrations

**Does Zerocracy Have Access to the Source Code?**
<br/>
No, we don't.
The [judges-action] plugin that you integrate into your GitHub repository
  collects information about your issues and pull requests,
  but not your source code.
You can check how the plugin works,
  since its source code is [openly hosted][judges-action] on GitHub.

**Can Zerocracy Work with GitLab and JIRA?**
<br/>
At the moment Zerocracy only works with GitHub-based projects.
However, if you have a reasonably big team, we can create an integration
  between your task tracker and Zerocracy.
