# What is L.A.P.?

The system of rewards and punishments is configured by three
  parameters: love (0..4), anger (0..4), and paranoia (1..4).

The higher the **love**, the more rewards we give for doing good, for example
  for fixing bugs,
  for resolving issues,
  and
  for reviewing pull requests.
If you want your team to move **faster** and deliver **more**, increase the love.

The higher the value of **anger**, the more severely we punish mistakes, for example
  for submitting too long pull requests,
  for taking too much time to resolve issues,
  and
  for making too long code reviews.
If you want to discipline your team, increase the anger.

The higher the value of **paranoia**, the higher the quality bar, for example
  we demand shorter pull requests
  and
  more than one code review per pull request.

When you start a project, we suggest using higher values of love.
When the project is running at full speed, lower the love and increase the anger.
When it's in the maintenance phase, keep the love at the minimum and increase the paranoia.
