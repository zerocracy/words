# How to Earn

If you're a programmer interested in working [remotely] and
  being [paid by result], Zerocracy is the [right place] for you.

After logging in, you'll see a [list] of currently funded
  products under development.
Simply jump into any of their GitHub repositories and start
  submitting [pull requests] or [bug reports].
There's no need to onboard, attend [meetings], or discuss requirements.

Our management style is very [similar] to what you might find
  in open source projectsâ€”but with [monetary] rewards.

Once 1) your [pull request][pull requests] is **merged**,
  2) you have [submitted][code reviews] a **code review**,
  or 3) your [issue][issues] is **accepted**
  ([labeled][labels] as a bug or enhancement),
  you [earn] a few points.
Each point is equal to one US dollar, debited to your Zerocracy account.
You can [withdraw] your funds at any time to
  your [ERC-20][ERC-20] [USDT][USDT] address.

How many points you earn per contribution depends on several factors.
Start working and you'll figure out for yourself which products pay
  more and faster.
